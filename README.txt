AUTOMATIC MR IMAGE SEGMENTATION
CS269 Final Project

Professor: Demetri Terzopoulos

Edgar Rios Piedra 
Harsh Jain 

PROGRAM USAGE

Select one folder that contains the 3d image files to be analyzed.
The program will run automatically and output a segmentation for the white matter and gray matter for every 
slice where there is enough tissue to make a segmentation

It is important that the Matalab that is running this program has the SPM and FSL libraries installed (added to path). 
Since we are making use of some of their utilities to preprocess the cerebral images
